##### By: Steven Nguyen

## Introduction

##### In this project I will use MySQL to explore and analyze data and then visualize the data in Tableau to provide insights to the stakeholders.

## Objective 
###### (*Please note that the names in the project are fictitious and are used only for the purpose of this project & the dataset is a mock dataset*)
##### I am a sales rep Tim Hart, who works for a beverage company covering Orlando, Florida. It is the end of the year performance review. I am tasked with presenting to senior leadership about my overall performance compared to the pervious year. They want to see if I increased market share in my area. They will need data driven insights from me to evaluate my performance and to see if I deserve a full merit increase in pay and if Iâ€™m ready for a promotion. To deliver data driven insights to my stakeholder I will answer questions like:
	1.Did KPIs increase YOY like account visits, cases sold, facings gained?
	2.How can I improve my performance as a sales rep for the upcoming year?
	3. Is There any correlation between key metrics and cases sold?
	4. Is there any trends?
